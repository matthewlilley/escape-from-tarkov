# Escape from Tarkov

Escape from Tarkov client.

## Quick start

[`examples`](./examples)

To run the worker example:

Rename the config.example.json in the examples folder to config.json, add your credentials, add a storage path, and then yarn examples:worker.

The storage path I've used on Linux is "/root/escape-from-tarkov/examples/storage", on Windows it'll be a Windows path like "C:\escape-from-tarkov\examples\storage".
